### Current Implementation Details

#### Cloudflare Worker Features ✅
- **Automated Processing**: Runs every 5 minutes via cron trigger
- **RSS Sources**: 12 Kenyan news sites with custom extractors
- **AI Processing**: OpenRouter integration with model fallbacks
- **Content Scraping**: Hybrid approach (direct + ScraperAPI fallback)
- **State Management**: Cloudflare KV for watermarks and statistics
- **Error Handling**: Resilient processing with detailed logging
- **Manual Triggers**: HTTP endpoints for testing and monitoring

### Ready for Deployment ✅

#### Prerequisites Met
- [x] Cloudflare account setup
- [x] OpenRouter API keys configured
- [x] Supabase database ready
- [x] Worker code fully implemented
- [x] Deployment scripts created
- [x] Testing utilities prepared

#### Deployment Scripts Ready
- [x] `scripts/deploy-worker.js` - Automated deployment
- [x] `scripts/test-worker.js` - Pre-deployment testing
- [x] `npm run deploy:worker` - One-command deployment
- [x] `npm run test:worker` - Validation testing

### Next Steps (Ready to Execute)

#### Immediate (30 minutes)
1. **Deploy Cloudflare Worker**
   ```bash
   cd pulse-website
   npm run test:worker    # Validate worker code
   npm run deploy:worker  # Deploy to Cloudflare
   ```

2. **Verify Automation**
   - Test status endpoint
   - Trigger manual processing
   - Verify articles in database
   - Monitor cron execution

#### Short-term (2 hours)
3. **Production Website Deployment**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:production  # Deploy to GitHub Pages
   ```

4. **Domain Configuration**
   - Set up pulse.utdnews.com DNS
   - Configure SSL certificates
   - Test production environment

#### Medium-term (1 day)
5. **Monitoring & Optimization**
   - Set up error alerts
   - Monitor processing statistics
   - Optimize performance
   - Add analytics tracking

### Success Metrics

#### Technical Metrics ✅
- [x] Application loads in <3 seconds
- [x] Database queries optimized
